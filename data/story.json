You were younger, hungry, always building the next version of yourself. She was one year younger than you, steady in a way you didn’t yet know how to keep. You dated long enough to learn each other’s rhythms… and ended it the way immature people end good things: with pride, bad timing, and words that never became closure.\n\nAfter that, you didn’t stay friends. You didn’t stay enemies either.\n\nYou just… didn’t stay.\n\nThen fate folds the years and drops you into the same place: Mecca, during Umrah — a season when you were tired of being clever.\n\nYou recognize her before you’re ready to.\n\nShe moves with the same quiet discipline: checking on an elderly pilgrim, offering water, adjusting a scarf without making a scene — like mercy is a job she does well, not a performance she sells.\n\nWhen you speak, she doesn’t romanticize you. She doesn’t ask why you left.\n\nShe asks one thing instead: ‘What kind of man are you when no one is watching?’\n\nIt lands like a test you can’t charm your way out of.\n\nThe scene breaks — not ending, just dissolving — the way memories do when you’re not ready to live in them.",
